          <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
          <p>
            At Psyfever, we strive to ensure a fair and transparent ticketing
            process for all users. Our refund policy is designed to protect both
            event organizers and ticket purchasers. Please read this policy
            carefully before making a purchase.
          </p>

          <h2>2. No Refunds After Purchase</h2>
          <p>
            As a general rule, <strong>all ticket sales are final</strong>. Once
            a ticket has been purchased, no refunds will be issued except in the
            specific circumstances outlined in this policy.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Exceptions for Event Rescheduling or Cancellation</h2>
          <p>Refunds may be possible in the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The event is rescheduled by the organizer</li>
            <li>The event is cancelled by the organizer</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In these cases, the issuance of refunds is the sole responsibility
            of the event organizer. Psyfever will facilitate the refund process
            but is not responsible for the final decision or the actual refund.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Organizer Responsibility</h2>
          <p>Event organizers are solely responsible for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Deciding whether to issue refunds in case of rescheduling or
              cancellation
            </li>
            <li>Communicating their refund policy to ticket holders</li>
            <li>Processing and issuing any approved refunds</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Refund Process</h2>
          <p>
            If an event is rescheduled or cancelled, and the organizer decides
            to offer refunds:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The organizer will notify Psyfever of their decision to issue
              refunds
            </li>
            <li>
              Psyfever will facilitate communication between the organizer and
              ticket holders
            </li>
            <li>
              Ticket holders will be provided instructions on how to request a
              refund
            </li>
            <li>
              The organizer will process approved refunds through the Psyfever
              platform
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>6. Timeframe for Refunds</h2>
          <p>
            If a refund is approved by the event organizer, it may take 5-10
            business days for the refund to be processed and reflected in the
            ticket holder's account, depending on the payment method used.
          </p>

            that:
          </p>

          <p>
            Any disputes regarding refunds should be directed to the event
            organizer. Psyfever will not mediate disputes between organizers and
            ticket holders but may provide relevant transaction information if
            required.
          </p>
